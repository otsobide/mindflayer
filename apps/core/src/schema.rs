//! What core hands a front end, and takes from one, as JSON Schema (#217):
//! what the `schema` feature adds, and nothing else builds.
//!
//! The local server's API is described by JSON Schema written from the Rust
//! types (D-24), as the panel's TypeScript is (`typescript`):
//! schemars derives most of it, beside each type's serde derive and from
//! the same attributes, so a derived type's schema says what serde writes
//! or reads. What serde writes by hand schemars cannot read, and it would
//! spell the Rust variants that a hand-written serializer exists not to, so
//! each such type is given its schema from what its serializer writes,
//! beside it, as its TypeScript is:
//!
//! - **A word**, a kind, an agent or a state: a string, one of the words,
//!   from the function its serializer calls ([`crate::described::words!`]),
//!   which writes its TypeScript too.
//! - **A path or a URL**, written as text whatever it holds: a string,
//!   which is what schemars says of a `PathBuf` and a `String` already, so
//!   a test holds each function a field is written through to the schema of
//!   the type it takes ([`crate::described::field_serializers`]).
//! - **Anything else**, an issue `validate` finds, a project's id, a
//!   template's origin, a skill's metadata, every code core gives: from
//!   what its serializer writes, beside it, each held to its serializer by
//!   a test.
//!
//! Each root is described the way the API uses it ([`Visitor`]): what it
//! is answered with as serde writes it, every field there and an `Option`
//! written as `null`; what it is sent as serde reads it, an `Option` that
//! may be left out left out of `required`. [`roots`] names each, and
//! [`Schemas`] writes each into a file of its own, every type it names in
//! its `$defs`, in JSON Schema 2020-12, which OpenAPI 3.1 takes as it is.
