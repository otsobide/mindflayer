//! Following a gather while it runs, and stopping it.
//!
//! A gather is the network, so it can take long enough that somebody wants to
//! know how it is going, and to change their mind. The front end hands it a
//! [`Watch`]: a callback it is told each [`Progress`] through, and a flag that
//! cancels it. Both are core's own types rather than `gix`'s progress tree and
//! interrupt, so a front end, the server that streams them included, depends
//! on neither gix's version nor the names it gives its steps.
