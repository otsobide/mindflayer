//! What core hands a front end, in TypeScript, for the panel to compile
//! against (#70): what the `ts` feature adds, and nothing else builds.
//!
//! ts-rs derives most of it, beside each type's serde derive and from the
//! same attributes, so a derived type says in TypeScript what serde writes.
//! What serde writes by hand ts-rs cannot read, and it would spell the Rust
//! variants that a hand-written serializer exists not to, so each such type
//! is given its TypeScript from what its serializer writes, beside it:
//!
//! - **A word**, a kind, an agent or a state: the union of the words, from
//!   the function its serializer calls ([`crate::described::words!`]).
//! - **A path or a URL**, written as text whatever it holds: a `string`,
//!   which is what ts-rs says of a `PathBuf` and a `String` already. Each
//!   field written through a function of its own (`serialize_with`) is one
//!   ts-rs reads as its type, so a test holds each such function to what
//!   ts-rs says of the type it takes, and
//!   [`crate::described::field_serializers`] finds every one a field names,
//!   for a test to refuse one it does not hold.
//! - **Anything else**, an issue `validate` finds, a template's origin, a
//!   skill's metadata: from what its serializer writes, beside it, each
//!   held to its serializer by a test.
//!
//! [`roots`] names what is exported, and every type each root names goes
//! with it, into `TS_RS_EXPORT_DIR`, which `.cargo/config.toml` points at
//! the panel. One list rather than `#[ts(export)]` on each root, so the
//! test that finds two types written to one file walks what the export
//! writes, and no other list.
