//! Moving a workspace a Mindflayer build made to Mindweaver's names (D-26),
//! when somebody asks for it: `mindweaver migrate --names`.
//!
//! Such a workspace is read as it was written, and written under its own
//! names, as every format is ([`crate::names`]): nothing moves it but this.
//! [`names_plan`] says what moving it would do, and [`names`] does it: its
//! `.mindflayer` renamed `.mindweaver`, and in it `flayer.toml` to
//! `weaver.toml`, `mindflayer.db` to `mindweaver.db` and every copy kept of
//! either beside it; each folder its marker names inside the old folder
//! pointed at the same place in the new one, and each gathered artifact the
//! ledger files there with it. In each project it links, the markers of
//! the block of `AGENTS.md` and of the import in `CLAUDE.md` are spelled the
//! new way, the block of the exclude file git reads for it too, and each of
//! Claude's rule files the ledger records in `.claude/rules/mindflayer` is
//! carried to `.claude/rules/mindweaver`, its record and its exclude line
//! with it; one that is not there has its record and its line pointed
//! there all the same, so the update that puts it back puts it under the
//! new name.
//!
//! Only what Mindweaver wrote moves, and only as it wrote it: a rule file
//! changed since, or something else in its place, is left where it is, its
//! record naming it there, which a render finds; one nothing records is
//! never looked at. A name already taken where something would go refuses
//! the whole move, and so does a block that cannot be read, a project whose
//! marker cannot, and a ledger another process has open, whose log a rename
//! would leave behind. The ledger is renamed, never migrated: it is the
//! same schema under another name.
//!
//! A workspace under Mindweaver's names is planned too, its projects alone,
//! so a second move takes what the first could not: a project it did not
//! find, a rule file put back as it was written.
//!
//! Git is never run. A project's rule files git tracks are moved from under
//! it all the same, as the folder they are in is Mindweaver's, and the plan
//! says so for a front end to say what to commit.
