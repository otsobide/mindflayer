//! What keeps an agent from what a project gives it, which the agent never
//! says: `mindweaver doctor` (#96).
//!
//! Some failures are silent. An untrusted Codex project ignores its
//! `.codex/config.toml`, an `AGENTS.override.md` hides `AGENTS.md`, a
//! `CLAUDE.local.md` stops Claude reading it, an unset secret variable
//! breaks a server and a skill at user scope can shadow a project's. Each
//! is a fact about what an agent reads, recorded in docs/agents.md, so each
//! check here rests on one of them and on the function that already reads
//! it for an install or a render, never a second reading of its own: Codex's
//! config through `codex_mcp`, the chain Codex reads through `agents_md`,
//! what keeps Claude from the block through `claude_md`.
//!
//! - **File reads alone.** Nothing is written, no lock is taken, and the
//!   ledger is opened only to read ([`WeaverWorkspace::ledger_for_reading`]).
//!   No agent is run: what an agent would do is what docs/agents.md says it
//!   does, and running one is the probe's, by hand.
//! - **Never the environment.** The front end says where each agent keeps
//!   its own folders and which variables are set, by name alone
//!   ([`Machine`]), as it says every agent home: core reads no environment,
//!   and a value read here could reach a report. Nothing a finding says
//!   holds a value.
//! - **A finding is no failure.** Each is a [`Symptom`], with a code of its
//!   own, the path it is about and what fixes it ([`Finding`]). What doctor
//!   could not read to tell is a failure, collected beside the findings of
//!   the project it is about ([`Examined::failures`]), as every report
//!   collects one, and never a reason to leave the rest unsaid.
