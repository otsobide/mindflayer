//! Installing a rule into a project, and taking it back out.
//!
//! A project marked by its settings is given its rules as sections of a
//! block in its `AGENTS.md` ([`crate::agents_md`]), the one file Claude Code,
//! Codex and OpenCode all read (D-03), and Claude reads that block natively,
//! through an import in the project's own `CLAUDE.md`
//! ([`crate::claude_md`]), or not at all, when its own rule files carry every
//! rule instead ([`crate::claude_rules`]). The block is one file, written
//! whole, so a project's rules are rendered together: installing one, or
//! taking one out, renders every rule the project has, each from where it was
//! installed from, as it is there now. A project a `mind.toml` marks has no
//! block: a rule is copied into the folder its marker names, filed by its
//! route, as a skill is copied into its folder.
//!
//! What is Mindflayer's is what the ledger records, as for a skill: one
//! installation a rule, with a target for its section, named by the file it
//! is in, and one for its file for Claude, each with the hash of what it
//! holds, and whether Mindflayer made the `AGENTS.md`, so that the file goes
//! with the last rule only when it was Mindflayer's to begin with. A
//! section in the block that the ledger does not record is somebody's, as a
//! copy nothing records is, and no render writes over it.
//!
//! In a local project (D-02), an `AGENTS.md` Mindflayer made is kept out of
//! git, and one git tracks is written only with `edit_tracked`: otherwise no
//! block is written, Claude gets every rule from its own rule files, and the
//! agents that read rules only in the block are said to miss them
//! ([`Warning::Withheld`]).
