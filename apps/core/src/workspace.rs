//! The two levels Mindflayer works at.
//!
//! A **mind project** is a directory carrying a `.mind`, the way a repository
//! carries a `.git`: its marker says which agents work in it, and it authors
//! skills and rules beside the code, in the directories the marker names
//! (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `rules/` by default).
//!
//! A **flayer workspace** sits above them, carrying a `.mindflayer` that
//! references the mind projects it manages, so their artifacts can be listed
//! and moved across several projects at once, and holds artifacts of its own
//! to share with them, in a library inside that `.mindflayer` by default.
//!
//! Both are found the way git finds a repository: by walking up from a
//! starting directory until the marker file appears. Both are described by a
//! marker file rather than by the directory alone, so an empty `.mind` left
//! behind by a failed copy is not mistaken for a project.
