//! Harvesting artifacts from somewhere else into a weaver workspace.
//!
//! Gathering fills the workspace's own shelf and stops there. Nothing is
//! written into a mind project: which of the gathered skills a project should
//! carry is a separate decision, made later and by somebody, and doing it here
//! would mean a `git clone` silently editing repositories.
//!
//! What lands where: a source's clone goes to
//! `.mindweaver/cache/<source>/`, and each artifact it yields is copied to
//! `.mindweaver/<kind folder>/<source>/<name>/`. Namespacing by source is what
//! lets two repositories both offer `commit-style`; [`crate::ledger`] is what
//! remembers which is which.
