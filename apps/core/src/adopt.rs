//! Bringing a skill somebody keeps in a project's agents' folders into the
//! workspace's library, and making the project's copies of it an
//! installation from there: `flayer adopt` (#59).
//!
//! Many repositories keep hand-written skills in `.claude/skills` or
//! `.agents/skills` already. Mindflayer lists each as foreign, never its to
//! change, so nothing it does reaches one: no update, and no copy for an
//! agent that reads the other folder. Adopting one, when asked and never by
//! itself, copies it into the library and records the project's copies as
//! installed from that copy, with the hash they hold, so from then on they
//! are managed as anything installed is ([`crate::install`]): current while
//! nobody changes them, edited once somebody does, outdated when the library
//! copy moves on. The project's bytes are never written: what is there is
//! what is recorded.
//!
//! So what is adopted is held to what an install could have written there,
//! since that is what every later look at it compares it with: a skill an
//! agent loads, by the Agent Skills rules a write is held to; the same bytes
//! in every target that has it; and nothing a copy cannot hold, a link or a
//! top-level `.claude-plugin`, which an install leaves out. Anything else is
//! refused, with the reason, rather than recorded under a hash an update
//! would then disagree with.
//!
//! [`plan`] says what adopting would do, writing nothing, the ledger read
//! without being made, and [`apply`] does it: under the workspace's lock,
//! planned again there, the library copy and the record written together or
//! not at all.
