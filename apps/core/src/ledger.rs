//! The workspace's record of what it gathered, from where, and what it did.
//!
//! Everything else Mindweaver writes is a file a person is meant to open: the
//! marker files are TOML with comments explaining themselves. This is the one
//! thing that is not, because it answers questions a file cannot: which of two
//! identically named skills came from which repository, at which revision, and
//! what happened the last four times a gather was run. It sits beside
//! `weaver.toml` in `.mindweaver/`, so it travels with the workspace it
//! describes and two workspaces never share a history.
//!
//! Nothing here decides *what* is worth gathering. It records what
//! [`crate::gather`] did.
//!
//! What it records is asked of a store through a port ([`LedgerStore`]):
//! SQLite unless another is handed over ([`Ledger::new`]), the adapter in
//! [`crate::adapter::sqlite`] holding every query and the schema. The types
//! here are what a store hands back, the same whichever one it is.
//!
//! Nor does it write a credential. Every URL is [`redacted`] on the way in,
//! whichever caller is writing, and again on the way out, for a row a
//! Mindweaver from before the redaction wrote, which stays in the file until
//! a command that writes scrubs it: the ledger is the one place everything
//! stored passes through, so it is where the guarantee is cheapest to keep.
