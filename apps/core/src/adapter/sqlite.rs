//! The [`LedgerStore`] a build keeps a workspace's records in: SQLite, in
//! `.mindflayer/mindflayer.db`, every query and every step of its schema.
//!
//! What it stores, and the promises it keeps of it (a URL kept redacted, a
//! write whole or not at all, a schema refused when it is newer than this
//! build reads), are the port's and [`crate::ledger`]'s; how, here. Why
//! SQLite is in docs/architecture.md ("Why the ledger is SQLite").
