//! One file of an artifact, read for a front end that shows it where a file
//! must never run: the web panel, which asks for it over the local server
//! (#67).
//!
//! What a skill holds is somebody else's: gathered from a repository, or put
//! in an agent's folder by another tool. A `SKILL.md` can carry a `<script>`,
//! an asset can be an HTML page or an SVG with a script inside, and a link
//! can lead anywhere on the disk. So a file reaches a front end only as
//! this module reads it:
//!
//! - **As text inside JSON, or not at all.** [`Contents`] holds the text as
//!   a string, which a front end puts on a page as text; nothing here says
//!   what type of file it is, so nothing downstream can serve it as one, and
//!   no file is ever handed over as its own bytes. A file that is not UTF-8,
//!   or holds a NUL, is said to be binary, with its size, and its bytes stay
//!   where they are.
//! - **Held to its holder once its links are followed**, by the check a copy
//!   makes of every link it meets ([`copy::followed`]): a file, or a folder
//!   on the way to it, that leads out of the project it belongs to, or for
//!   the workspace's own out of the folder it keeps that kind in, is
//!   refused, never read. Before that, the file is named by a route of plain
//!   names from the artifact, so a `..` never gets as far as the disk.
//! - **No bigger than [`CAP`]**: one larger is said to be too large, with its
//!   size, and never read whole, so a browser cannot make the server read a
//!   disk image into memory by naming one.
//!
//! What an artifact holds is listed the same way ([`Files`]): every file and
//! folder by its route, a link judged by the same check before it is
//! followed, one leading out of the holder or back into a folder above it
//! listed with why and never followed, and no more than [`FILES_CAP`] of
//! them, so a front end can show a skill's tree and ask for each file in it
//! by the route it lists.
//!
//! Rules in core, as every rule about a path is: the server carries what this
//! answers and the panel draws it, and neither could disagree with the other
//! about what may be read.
