//! Keeping paths out of git without touching the team's `.gitignore`.
//!
//! A project in local mode keeps what Mindflayer installs into it out of git
//! (D-02), and the file that can say so without being committed is
//! `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`: git reads it like a `.gitignore` but never
//! tracks it, and every linked worktree of the repository reads the same one.
//! Mindflayer writes there only between `# mindflayer:begin` and
//! `# mindflayer:end`, one group per project:
//!
//! ```text
//! # mindflayer:begin
//! # project 4f9c2a7e1b3d5f60a8c4e2b6d0f1a3c5
//! /packages/app/.agents/skills/commit-style/
//! /packages/app/.claude/skills/commit-style/
//! # project 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
//! /packages/web/.agents/skills/review/
//! # mindflayer:end
//! ```
//!
//! Several projects can share one repository, so each owns a group under its
//! own header and an edit for one never rewrites another's lines. Everything
//! outside the block is somebody else's and comes back byte for byte.
//!
//! Not `.gitignore`, which is the team's: it is committed, so a line there
//! puts copies one machine has into every teammate's diff. Not
//! `core.excludesFile` either, which is the user's and spans every
//! repository they have. Mindflayer edits neither, ever.
