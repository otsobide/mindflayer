//! The adapters: what implements each of core's ports ([`crate::port`]) with
//! a library or the system, the one place a build says which.
//!
//! Each is the default its port is given wherever nothing else is handed
//! over, as D-14 chose for HTTP: [`gix::Gix`] fetches a source,
//! [`reqwest::Reqwest`] sends a request over HTTP, and [`SystemClock`] tells
//! the time. Another adapter is written beside them
//! against the same port and handed to what takes the port, a gather's
//! [`Request::through`](crate::gather::Request::through), the ledger's
//! [`with_clock`](crate::ledger::Ledger::with_clock) or an HTTP
//! [`Client::new`](crate::http::Client::new); nothing behind the port
//! changes. A test's fake is one more adapter, and lives with the test.
