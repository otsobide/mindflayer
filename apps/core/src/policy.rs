//! What a request from outside may name: the path policy every task the
//! panel's browser sends passes before a line of it runs (#67, D-18).
//!
//! The panel turns a task into command lines and runs them as a person at a
//! terminal would, which is the point: nothing it does is something a
//! command could not. But a person typing a path knows what they meant, and
//! a browser is a stranger whose request reached the server with the token,
//! from a page that may not be the panel's. So a task is held to less than
//! a command line is:
//!
//! - **A project or a loaded workspace is named by its entry**, spelled as
//!   the workspace's marker spells it, which is how a snapshot lists it
//!   ([`linked`], [`loaded`]). Never by a name, nor by a path the front end
//!   joins itself: the front end turns the entry into the path the registry
//!   resolves, and names the project to the command by that.
//! - **A folder that is not linked yet is named by a path that reads the same
//!   from anywhere** ([`path`]): absolute, spelled as normalizing it would
//!   spell it, so that what the preview shows is the folder the command
//!   acts on, and outside every `.mindweaver` (and `.mindflayer`), where a workspace keeps its
//!   marker, its ledger, its library and the clones it gathered, none of
//!   which is a project to make or link. A path that leads into one through
//!   a link is refused as one inside it.
//! - **A workspace to switch to is named by its path as a list of core's
//!   spells it** ([`switched`]): one of the workspaces this machine knows,
//!   or the one the front end was launched on ([`crate::known::switchable`]),
//!   matched character for character against that list and never opened as
//!   given, so a front end that stays on one workspace goes to no other.
//!
//! Each refusal has a code, as every error core gives does
//! ([`crate::code`]), and the front end runs nothing of a task one of its
//! values is refused for. Here rather than in the panel's backend, because
//! a rule about which paths may be named is one a second front end would
//! otherwise write again, and could write differently.
