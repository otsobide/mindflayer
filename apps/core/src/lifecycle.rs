//! Changing what a project holds: adding to it, finding an artifact by what
//! somebody typed, editing it, renaming it, removing it.
//!
//! Finding is more forgiving than listing. A skill whose front matter does not
//! parse is left out of every listing, but it is exactly the one somebody
//! needs to open and fix, so an artifact is also found by where its name would
//! put it on disk, whether or not it reads.
//!
//! Each change also sees to the ledger's record of what was installed under
//! the names it touches, and says in its result what it did ([`Record`]). The
//! rule is D-04's: an installed copy that is edited or renamed stays
//! recorded, told by the hash of what was written, and an edit, a skill's
//! rename among them, reads as edited, never written over or deleted unless
//! forced; one that is removed is uninstalled, its record going with it; and
//! one added where a record outlived its copy drops that record. It lives
//! here rather than in a front end, so that no front end can apply it
//! differently. Only one that changes things through these functions gets
//! it, though: [`create`] and [`create_from`], the writers [`add`] is built
//! on, see to no record, and a front end that added with them would leave a
//! stale one in place.
//!
//! Changing a record opens the ledger to write, which scrubs it first
//! ([`FlayerWorkspace::ledger_to_write`]), so each result that may also hands
//! back what that took out ([`Scrub`]) for the front end to say. Said
//! nowhere, it would go unsaid for good: a scrub says what it found only the
//! first time. An edit changes none, and only reads the ledger.
