//! Putting an artifact from the workspace shelf into a mind project, and

//!
//! Three places offer what can be installed: the workspace's own artifacts,
//! the own artifacts of every workspace it loads (read where they are), and
//! the shelf gathering fills. This is the other half. It writes into a mind
//! project, the only thing in Mindflayer that does, and the rule it works by
//! is that **it only manages what it installed**. An artifact somebody wrote by
//! hand is neither overwritten nor deleted, whatever a caller asks for, and it
//! is told so rather than being obeyed quietly. Which of the two a file is, is
//! what [`crate::ledger`] remembers.
//!
//! Where in the project is its agents' to say: a copy in each folder one of
//! them reads ([`targets`]), written together and recorded as one
//! installation, so that every agent the project names runs the same skill.
//! A rule is no folder: it reaches a project marked by its settings as a
//! section of the block in its `AGENTS.md`, rendered with every other rule
//! the project has, and one a `mind.toml` marks as a copy of its file
//! ([`rules`]).
