//! Everything a workspace holds, read in one go for a front end to draw: the
//! snapshot every front end reads, the TUI first and the web panel next.
//!
//! One read rather than each front end putting its view together from the
//! reports, as the TUI did: which failure belongs to which artifact, which
//! install nothing of is found, how many of its own a loaded workspace
//! offers, are answers, and two front ends working them out would come to
//! two of them. Core builds and orders it, from the same types the CLI
//! prints, and a front end only chooses how to show it. A [`Listing`] is a
//! part of it, its holders read for the kinds asked: what `list --json`
//! prints, so a script reads a project as a front end draws it.
//!
//! - **A read, and nothing more.** No file is made or changed: the ledger is
//!   opened only through [`FlayerWorkspace::ledger_for_reading`], the
//!   default workspace is never made for it, and no scrub runs. A ledger
//!   from an older schema is migrated, as every open migrates it, which is
//!   upkeep of Mindflayer's own file rather than a change.
//! - **No scan.** What could be linked comes from [`crate::scan`], a query
//!   of its own run when somebody asks, since a walk of the disk is no price
//!   to pay for every live update of a screen.
//! - **Its names are a contract**, as a report's are: every field by its
//!   name, a kind, an agent and a state by the word a command line takes,
//!   and every URL through [`redacted`](crate::url::redacted), where it is
//!   written. [`FORMAT`] moves when a field goes or changes what it holds.
//! - **Failures are collected**, beside what they are about: a project's in
//!   the project, the library's in the library, and what belongs to neither
//!   in [`Snapshot::warnings`]. A ledger that cannot be read is about every
//!   project's records and the shelf alike, so each of them says it.
