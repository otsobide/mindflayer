//! Whether Claude Code reads a project's `AGENTS.md`, and the import that
//! makes it read the file where a `CLAUDE.md` is in the way.
//!
//! The block of rules in `AGENTS.md` ([`crate::agents_md`]) reaches Codex
//! and OpenCode wherever it is, but Claude reads that file natively only
//! when no `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.local.md` is in the
//! folder it starts in or any folder above it (docs/agents.md, verified on
//! 2.1.309 but for `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, seen only among the names it looks
//! for). One predicate decides it, [`reads_agents_md`], so whatever gives
//! Claude its rules asks the same question and never reads the block as
//! reaching Claude where it does not (D-03).
//!
//! Where the project's own `CLAUDE.md` is what is in the way, one line in
//! it brings `AGENTS.md` in, between the markers the block of `AGENTS.md`
//! has, at the top of a file that is otherwise somebody else's:
//!
//! ```text
//! <!-- mindflayer:begin -->
//! @AGENTS.md
//! <!-- mindflayer:end -->
//!
//! # Working here
//! ```
//!
//! The layout the probe verified, with the file loaded once (docs/agents.md).
//! Everything outside the block comes back byte for byte, but for the empty
//! line just below the end marker, which is the block's ([`ClaudeMd`]), and a
//! block that is not exactly one well-formed one is refused, never repaired,
//! as in `AGENTS.md`: the markers are read by the same search
//! (`agents_md::locate`).
//!
//! [`reach`] decides how Claude gets the block, from the predicate, the
//! project's settings and whether the block was written: natively, through
//! an import of `AGENTS.md` the project's files already hold, Mindflayer's
//! or somebody's, through the import added, or not at all, when Claude's
//! own rules folder is to hold every rule instead ([`Reach::mode`],
//! [`crate::claude_rules`]). Never both a block Claude reads and a rule
//! file for the same rule, so Claude reads each rule once. [`render`] adds
//! the import where the reach says, and takes it out everywhere else.
//! Which rules a project is given, and when to render, are the caller's
//! ([`crate::install::rules`]), as for the block itself.
