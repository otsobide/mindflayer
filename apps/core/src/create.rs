//! Writing a new artifact into a mind project.
//!
//! The one way into a project that is not a copy from the shelf: a skill, a
//! rule or an MCP server somebody is about to write, scaffolded so that it
//! passes `validate` from the moment it exists. Without a template, what is
//! written is the least that does: a skill's front matter and a heading, a
//! rule's opening line, and for a server, which a name and a description do
//! not say how to start, the definition written from what a command line
//! said of its transport ([`Given`]). With one, the template is copied and
//! the name and description filled in.
//!
//! Nothing here records anything in the ledger. A created artifact is its
//! author's work, not something Mindweaver installed, so [`crate::install`]
//! treats it as foreign: never overwritten by a shelf entry of the same name,
//! never removed by unticking one. Nor does anything here drop a record: an
//! old one under the name written is [`crate::lifecycle::add`]'s to drop, so
//! a front end adds with that rather than with these. They stay public as the
//! bare writers, which core's tests build their fixtures with.
