//! The ports: what core needs of the world beyond the files it reads and
//! writes, each as a trait core's rules are written against, with the
//! adapter a build runs with in [`crate::adapter`].
//!
//! The architecture is hexagonal. Core's rules (what a skill is, what an
//! install may overwrite, which copy is edited) sit in the middle and depend
//! on nothing outside them; whatever they need from outside is a port here,
//! a trait in core's own words; and an adapter on the edge implements it with
//! a library (`gix` for a [`Remote`], SQLite for a [`LedgerStore`], the
//! system clock for a [`Clock`]). The
//! front ends, the CLI, the TUI and the panel's backend, are the other side's
//! adapters: they drive core through its functions and the command lines
//! every one of them runs (`commands::run_line`), and add nothing core has to
//! know. So a new store, transport or clock is an adapter written against a
//! port, and a new front end is one more driver of the same commands: neither
//! changes a rule.
//!
//! This is the seam D-14 chose for HTTP, kept for every port: an injectable
//! trait, a default adapter built in, and a fake in a test. A port speaks only
//! core's types. What an adapter's library says is turned into those at the
//! edge (an error into text, a commit into a [`Revision`]), rather than
//! carried through, which would tie core's public API to the library's
//! version and let a rule depend on how one library happens to work.
//!
//! The files themselves are not behind a port. What core promises about them
//! is how they are written (`create_new`, a temporary renamed into place, a
//! link never followed out of its holder), and those promises are made of the
//! operating system's own calls; an adapter that only seemed to keep them is
//! the failure a port here would invite (docs/architecture.md, "Values,
//! ports and adapters").
