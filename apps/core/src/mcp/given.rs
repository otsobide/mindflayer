//! What `add` is told of an MCP server it writes a definition for: how an
//! agent starts the server or reaches it, as a command line's options say,
//! and the definition's text written from them.
//!
//! Every value is a name or a literal the definition holds as it is, as
//! #86's model has it. A literal is written as typed (`--env K=V`,
//! `--header K=V`), and judged as every value of a transport is, so one
//! shaped like a token is refused. Every other option declares an input,
//! read from the variable it names and never given a value (D-11), and
//! named after that variable, so its placeholder says which one: `{VAR}`.
//! Which of those is a secret is said here, once ([`Program`],
//! [`Address`]): what reaches a server through its environment or a
//! header is, and what goes into its arguments or its address is not,
//! being what a process list, a log or a proxy shows, and what Codex has
//! no way to read a secret into.
//!
//! Nothing here judges what it writes. The text is read back and held to
//! the one strict function `validate` and `rename` hold a definition to
//! ([`crate::create`]), so `add` refuses exactly what `validate` would call
//! invalid. What no definition can hold at all, two transports, or an
//! option of one given with the other, no value of this type can say: a
//! front end's grammar refuses it before one is made.
//!
//! The other way round, a definition is read back as what `add` would be
//! told to write it ([`Given::of`]), when the options can say all of it:
//! what a form changing one starts from, and what `edit` writes from
//! again ([`retransported`]), every other key of the file kept.
