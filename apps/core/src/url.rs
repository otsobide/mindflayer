/// `text` with every URL in it stripped of the credentials its userinfo
/// carries, so a source can be stored, logged and named in an error without
/// repeating a token somebody typed into it.
///
/// A whole URL is a text with one URL in it. Error text is the other kind:
/// `gix` quotes the URL it failed on among its own words, and a URL git config
/// rewrote with `insteadOf` can carry a credential the typed one did not.
///
/// What goes is everything before the `@` of a `scheme://` URL, except the
/// user name of an ssh URL. That one is who ssh logs in as, which is part of
/// where the repository is rather than a secret, and a later gather from the
/// stored URL needs it. Over http(s) a user name goes too: GitHub takes a
/// token in that place, and a credential helper is what names the user. The
/// scp-like form (`git@host:path`) is left alone, because it has no room for a
/// password: `gix` reads everything before its first `:` as user and host.
///
/// The userinfo is looked for up to the first `/` or whitespace after the
/// `://`, which for an http(s) URL with a `?` or `#` before any `/` is further
/// than `gix` reads it: cutting too much from an odd URL is the safe way to be
/// wrong. Parsing with `gix::url` and dropping the user was the other way, and
/// is rejected because the parser also rewrites what it keeps (a default port
/// dropped, a scheme lowercased), so the error would name a URL nobody typed,
/// and because it cannot find a URL inside an error message.
///
/// A password typed with a `/` in it is the one place the first `/` is too
/// soon: `https://me:p/ss@host` reads to every parser as host `me` and port
/// `p`, which no URL can have, so it is refused as unparseable and would be
/// stored, logged and repeated whole. When what comes before the first `/`
/// has a `:` followed by anything but a port's digits, the `@` is looked for
/// up to the next whitespace instead. A password of digits alone cut by a `/`
/// still reads as a host, a port and a path, to `gix` as to this.
