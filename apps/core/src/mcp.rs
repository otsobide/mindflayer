//! What an MCP server's definition declares about the server.
//!
//! One file per server, `<name>.toml` in a library's `mcp` folder (D-10),
//! which an install will render as one entry in each agent's own config
//! file, keyed by that name (#90 to #94). Only what the file holds lives
//! here. A definition as a thing on disk is an
//! [`Artifact`](crate::artifact::Artifact) of the kind [`Kind::Mcp`], found,
//! shown, validated, renamed and removed as every kind is; this is the half
//! that is specific to MCP servers.
//!
//! [`Kind::Mcp`]: crate::kind::Kind::Mcp
//!
//! Neutral rather than any agent's shape: a subset of the MCP registry's
//! `server.json`, so an entry from the registry maps onto it (#106), with
//! its inputs typed. Writing Claude's, Codex's or OpenCode's own shape would
//! make the file one agent's and every other a translation of it, and
//! storing `server.json` as it is would keep what no agent reads (packages,
//! a registry's metadata) and none of what an input needs to say.
//!
//! ```toml
//! format = 1
//! name = "github"
//! description = "GitHub's issues, pull requests and code"
//!
//! [transport]
//! type = "stdio"
//! command = "npx"
//! args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
//! env = { GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN = "{token}" }
//!
//! [[inputs]]
//! name = "token"
//! kind = "env"
//! secret = true
//! env_var = "GITHUB_TOKEN"
//! ```
//!
//! An input is what somebody supplies when an agent starts the server, never
//! a value the file holds (D-11): it is written between braces, `{token}`,
//! where its value goes, and its `kind` says where that may be. A brace that
//! names no input is left as it is written, so a JSON argument such as
//! `{"debug":true}` means what it says.
//!
//! The format is held here: a file that reads as one, a transport that
//! names what it needs to start or reach the server, every input named so
//! that its placeholder can be written and read from a variable every agent
//! can refer to, and every input used where its kind says. So are its
//! secrets (D-11): a secret input names the variable it is read from, and no
//! value holds what looks like a token written as it is (`token`). Beside
//! it, which names a server can be given ([`name`]), and what each agent
//! cannot be given of a definition ([`Inexpressible`]), which no `validate`
//! says, since the definition is whole for every other agent.
