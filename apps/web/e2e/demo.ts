description: How our HTTP APIs are shaped, from resource names to errors and pagination. Use when adding or changing an endpoint.
---

# API conventions

Every service here speaks the same HTTP, so a client written for one works
for the next.

## Resources

- Plural nouns for collections, \`/invoices\`, and an id below them,
  \`/invoices/{id}\`. No verbs in a path: an action is a resource of its own,
  \`POST /invoices/{id}/refunds\`.
- JSON bodies, with fields in \`snake_case\` and times in RFC 3339.

## Errors

Answer with the status that says what went wrong, and a body a program can
act on:

\`\`\`json
{ "error": { "code": "invoice_closed", "message": "A closed invoice cannot change." } }
\`\`\`

## Pagination

By cursor: \`?limit=\` up to 100, and a \`next\` cursor in the answer while
there is more. Never by offset, which skips rows as others are inserted.

1. The main branch is green, and the release notes are written.
2. Deploy to staging and run the smoke tests.
3. Watch the dashboards for ten minutes: errors, latency, saturation.
4. Deploy to production behind the flag, then ramp it up.
5. Say so in #releases, with a link to the notes.
