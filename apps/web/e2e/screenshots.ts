/*
 * The README's screenshots, which `make docs/screenshots` takes:
 *
 *   MINDFLAYER_E2E_BIN=../../target/debug node e2e/screenshots.ts
 *
 * Taken, never drawn by hand, so they show the panel as it is: the demo
 * workspace (demo.ts) built with the binaries under test, served by their
 * `flayer ui`, and every page of the tour opened in Chromium at one size
 * and written into docs/images. It runs as the end-to-end suite does
 * (environment.ts): no variable leading to a real workspace or agent home,
 * a temporary home holding only the default workspace the demo makes
 * there, every command pinned. Not a spec, so `make
 * web/e2e` never runs it, and Playwright's library rather than its runner:
 * the pages are visited once, in order, some after another has changed the
 * workspace.
 *
 * At a fixed place under the system's temporary folder rather than one
 * made fresh, since every page shows where the workspace is and a path
 * that changed with each run would change every image. Nowhere under a
 * home: an image shows the paths it was taken over, and before one is
 * written the page it shows is read for a home's path, the account's name
 * and the launch token, any of which fails the run.
