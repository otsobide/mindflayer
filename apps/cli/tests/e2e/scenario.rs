//! The world an end-to-end test builds for itself, and what one command run
//! in it gave back.
//!
//! A scenario is a temporary folder standing for `/home`, with `you` in it as
//! the home of the person running the commands. Every path a test spells is
//! spelled as that person would, `~/Projects/collapse` or
//! `/home/you/Projects`, and every path a command prints is read back the
//! same way, so what a test expects reads as the reference shows it
//! (`docs/reference.md`), where the home is `/home/you` too.
//!
//! Each command is the built binary, started as a process from the folder it
//! is typed in, with an environment holding nothing but `PATH` and that home:
//! no `MINDWEAVER_*` or `MINDFLAYER_*` variable, no agent home and no git
//! configuration of the developer's reaches it, and no option is added to the
//! line to keep them out, so the line run is the line typed. A variable a test is about is
//! given to that one command alone.
