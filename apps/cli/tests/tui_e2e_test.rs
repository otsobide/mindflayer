//! The TUI end to end: `flayer` and `mind` on their own, the screen a
//! person works in, driven one use case at a time in a terminal of its own.
//!
//! The screen's own suite (`tui_test`) drives its state with key events and
//! renders it into ratatui's test backend, without a terminal; what lies
//! between that and a person goes untested there: the event loops, raw mode
//! and the alternate screen, the keys as a terminal sends them, and the
//! transcript printed once the window is given back. Here each test is one
//! use case, in three parts, as in the CLI's end-to-end suite (`e2e_test`):
//!
//! - the scenario it needs, built from nothing for that test alone, with
//!   the CLI suite's own [`Scenario`];
//! - the binary started in a pseudo-terminal of its own from a folder of
//!   it ([`Terminal`]), and the keys a person presses, typed into it;
//! - what the screen draws, row by row where it is laid out and by what a
//!   row says where a path in a box would read otherwise as `/home`, the
//!   transcript the terminal shows once the screen has closed, and what it
//!   left on the disk.
//!
//! Every wait is for what is to be drawn, bounded, never a sleep, so a
//! slow machine is slower and no less certain. Unix alone, as a
//! pseudo-terminal is.
