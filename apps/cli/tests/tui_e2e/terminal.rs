//! A terminal for the screen to run in, and what it shows.
//!
//! The TUI is the built binary, started from a folder of the scenario with
//! the environment every command there gets, in a pseudo-terminal of a size
//! of its own, as a shell in a terminal window starts it: the leader of a
//! session of its own, with that terminal as its controlling one, so
//! crossterm reads its size and its keys there, never the developer's
//! terminal, nor none at all under CI. What it draws is fed to a VT100
//! parser (`vt100`), and a test reads the screen as rows of text, paths in
//! them read as `/home`, as a person reads the window.
//!
//! The screen draws when it is ready and redraws when something changes, so
//! a test waits for what it expects to show (`Terminal::shows`), bounded,
//! and fails with the screen as it was when the wait ran out.
