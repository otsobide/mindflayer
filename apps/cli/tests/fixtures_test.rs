//! The snapshots the panel's tests render from, the answers to what its
//! page of an artifact asks, and what previewing and running a few tasks is
//! answered with, written from the real thing: workspaces built by running
//! the commands, read and changed through the panel's backend as the server
//! answers it, and written into the panel's `tests/fixtures` (`make
//! web/fixtures`), committed beside its tests.
//!
//! Written rather than drawn by hand, so that a test of the panel renders
//! what core says and nothing a person imagined it says: a field added,
//! renamed or holding something else reaches the fixtures the next time
//! they are written, and `make web/fixtures/check`, which CI's `types drift
//! (web)` runs, fails until they are committed. Under the `ts` feature, as
//! the export of the panel's types is, so a plain `cargo test` writes
//! nothing anywhere.
//!
//! What would differ from one run to the next is pinned: the temporary
//! folder reads as `/home`, each project's id is one of [`IDS`], and every
//! time the ledger keeps is [`AT`] or a minute after the one before.

# review

Read the diff **before** it lands, and say what you would change.

## Steps

1. Run `scripts/diff.sh` to see what changed.
2. Go through [the checklist](references/checklist.md).
3. Leave one comment per finding, and *say why*.

| check | why |
| :--- | ---: |
| tests | they pass |

The long version is at <https://example.com/review>.

```sh
scripts/diff.sh main
