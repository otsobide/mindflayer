//! The CLI end to end: `mind` and `mindweaver`, the binaries a person runs,
//! driven one use case at a time.
//!
//! Every other suite of the CLI stops short of the process: it parses a line
//! with the real parsers and runs it in the test's own process
//! (`common::mind`, `common::weaver`), its options pinned so it reaches no
//! real home. Here each command is the built binary, started from a folder
//! with an environment of its own, and what a test holds is what a person
//! sees: the exit status, stdout and stderr, word for word, and what the
//! command left on the disk.
//!
//! Each test is one use case, in three parts:
//!
//! - the scenario it needs, built from nothing for that test alone
//!   ([`Scenario`]): folders and git repositories as a person or a git
//!   server makes them, and Mindweaver's own state only through the commands
//!   themselves (`given`), each held to exit 0 with nothing on stderr;
//! - one command, the input of the use case, as it is typed in a shell;
//! - its output, as the reference shows it (`docs/reference.md`): every path
//!   under the scenario reads as `/home`, the home being `/home/you`.
//!
//! No test shares a scenario with another or depends on one having run, so
//! any one of them runs alone (`cargo test -p mindweaver-cli --test e2e_test
//! <name>`). The use cases are grouped by what a person is doing: making
//! projects and workspaces, writing skills and rules, installing them,
//! gathering them from git, keeping copies up to date, reading what is
//! where, saying which workspace a command is about, changing a project's
//! agents, share and targets, adopting a skill somebody keeps, removing
//! one everywhere, loading another workspace, upgrading what an older
//! Mindweaver made, and reading it all as JSON.
//!
//! Unix alone: the reference's paths are a Unix home's, which a Windows
//! path, its drive and its backslashes, never reads as, so every use case
//! printing a path would fail there for how the path is spelled rather
//! than for what the command did.
