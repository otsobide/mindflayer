//! What the panel sends the CLI's backend and is answered with, in

//! (`mindflayer_core::typescript`).
//!
//! Derived, every type serde reads or writes: a query, a task and what a
//! run produced go through serde's derive, which ts-rs reads, so none needs
//! words of its own, and what they name of core's, a kind, an agent, what
//! went wrong, is written as core writes it. Only `Code`, which serde never
//! sees, is written by hand.
