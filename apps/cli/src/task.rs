//! Work a front end asks for, as the command lines it is.
//!
//! A [`Task`] is what a key in the TUI asks for, and what the panel will ask
//! for over the local server (D-18): not a description of the work, but the
//! work, since [`Task::commands`] is exactly the words the caller parses,
//! with the parsers `mind` and `mindweaver` use, and runs. Here rather than in
//! the TUI, where it was born, so that every front end that runs commands
//! builds its lines one way: a second one writing its own would be a second
//! place for a line to be spelled wrong, or for a value to be taken for a
//! flag.
//!
//! **No value a task holds is read as an option, or as a command.** A task
//! sent by a browser holds whatever the browser put in it, so a path, a name
//! or a description that starts with a dash has to reach the command as
//! that value: `--yes` as a description must not confirm anything. The words
//! of the command itself are fixed here, never taken from a field, so a
//! value cannot name another command, and each value goes one of three
//! ways: after the option that takes it, joined to it by `=` when it starts
//! with a dash (`option`); as a `-C` or `-p` that starts with one, behind a
//! `./` that names the same directory (`directory`); or as a positional,
//! behind a `--` whenever one of them starts with a dash (`words`). A test
//! feeds every variant values that start with a dash, and finds each line
//! read as the same line with a plain value is, each option and positional
//! holding the value as given wherever the plain one was, behind its `./`
//! under a `-C` or a `-p`.
//! Shown, a line is quoted so that, pasted into a shell, it runs as one
//! command of exactly these words ([`shell`]).
