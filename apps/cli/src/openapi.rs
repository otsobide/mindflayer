//! The API the panel's backend serves, described as an OpenAPI 3.1
//! document (#218, D-24): what the `schema` feature adds beside the
//! schemas, and nothing else builds.
//!
//! Put together here, where both tables and every type are known: the
//! server writes what is HTTP of each route of its own table and of the
//! backend's ([`mindweaver_server::schema::paths`]), and asks this module
//! for the schema of each type a route names ([`Describe`]), each found by
//! the name the route gives it among the roots core, the CLI and the
//! server list, as a file of `docs/api/schemas` is. Walking the very
//! tables that are served, rather than a description beside the handlers,
//! so the two cannot disagree; and written into `docs/api/openapi.json`
//! by a test (`make api/openapi`), committed, and served as those bytes
//! (`PanelBackend::document`), so a plain build has it without compiling
//! schemars.
//!
//! Every type a route names is a definition of `components.schemas`, the
//! way the route uses it ([`Way`]), and every place the server carries the
//! backend's JSON is said of the CLI's types there, by the server's word
//! for it ([`Carried`]). A type both sent and answered whose two ways
//! differ, as a task does, sent closed and with what serde reads as none
//! left out of `required`, answered open with every field there, is two
//! definitions, the one sent named with `Sent` after it ([`SENT`]); one
//! described alike both ways, a word, is one.
