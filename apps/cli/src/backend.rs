//! The panel's backend: what the local server hands each request from the
//! browser to (#67).
//!
//! The server is transport, generic over a [`Backend`] and depending on no
//! mindweaver crate (D-17); this is the CLI's, with its own [`Query`], the
//! [`Task`] the TUI runs, and an [`Outcome`] of its own. It is a front end
//! as the TUI is, and works as the TUI does (D-18): a read is a query core
//! answers, the snapshot or a file's contents, and a change is a task turned
//! into the command lines it is, each shown before it runs, with what of it
//! the panel has somebody confirm first ([`Confirm`]), then run through the
//! real parsers ([`run_line`]) on the server's one writer thread.
//!
//! What it adds is distrust, since every request comes from a browser:
//!
//! - **It acts on one workspace at a time**, the one the panel was launched
//!   on, resolved once ([`PanelBackend::launch`]), until it is switched to
//!   another ([`Backend::switch`]), and only to one core lists
//!   ([`Query::Workspaces`]): a workspace this machine knows, or the
//!   launch's. Each line it runs names it with `-W`, so a change made
//!   meanwhile elsewhere on the disk cannot send a line to another, and a
//!   line copied from the panel reaches the same one; but for a root that
//!   is not UTF-8, which no word can hold, and which every line reaches all
//!   the same through what it runs with.
//! - **The browser supplies no `-C`, `--home`, `-W` or agent home.** A task
//!   has no field for them, no value it holds is read as an option, and
//!   every line runs with the launch's home and agent homes, from the
//!   workspace's root, as the TUI's do.
//! - **A task names only what the path policy allows** ([`Admission`]): a
//!   project by its entry, which becomes the folder the registry resolves,
//!   and a folder not linked yet by an absolute, normalized path outside
//!   every `.mindweaver`, shown verbatim.
//! - **A task no front end without a terminal runs is refused**
//!   ([`Task::refusal`]): a screen, an editor, a shell's code, a gather, and
//!   `show`, which prints an artifact whole through any link.
//! - **A scan walks only the folders the browser names**, each held to the
//!   path policy as a folder to link is, and is only read: it is asked for
//!   by hand ([`Query::Scan`]), never with the snapshot, which a live update
//!   reads again on every change.
//! - **A folder is listed only where the browser may name one**, held to
//!   the path policy as a folder to link is, and is only read: what is
//!   directly inside it, for the panel's explorer to pick one from
//!   ([`Query::Folders`]), which runs nothing.
//! - **A plan names only linked projects**, each box's by its entry, held
//!   to the path policy as a task's projects are, and is only read: what
//!   the boxes ticked amount to is core's to say ([`Query::Plan`]), and
//!   nothing runs until its tasks are sent back.
//! - **What an update would do is only read** ([`Query::Updates`]): the
//!   dry run of `mindweaver update --all`, core's, naming nothing a browser
//!   sent; an update runs only as the task the panel sends for it.
//! - **A draft is only judged** ([`Query::Validate`]): what core says of an
//!   artifact a form or the editor is about to send, by the checks the
//!   command makes and in its words, with what `validate` would say of it;
//!   nothing is written until the task that writes it is sent.
//! - **A file reaches the browser only as text inside JSON**, held to its
//!   holder once its links are followed, and never larger than core's cap
//!   ([`Contents`]): the one way a file's contents leave, since `show` is
//!   refused. What an artifact holds is listed the same way ([`Files`]),
//!   each file by the route a file is then asked for by.
//!
//! Every refusal has a code, as every error does, and nothing of a refused
//! task runs. A read whose parameters name what is not there, an entry, an
//! artifact, a file or a folder, is refused as absent, a 404; every other
//! refusal, a task's, a switch's and whatever a body sends among them, as
//! unfit, a 422 ([`Absence`]).
