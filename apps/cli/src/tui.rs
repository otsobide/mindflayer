//! The TUI: every project a workspace manages, and a key for each command.
//!
//! `flayer` on its own opens it. What it changes, it changes by running a
//! command line (`flayer link beta`, `mind -C beta add skill deploy '…'`),
//! parsed by the parsers the binaries use and run through the same functions,
//! and those lines are printed when it closes. There is nothing the screen can
//! do that a command cannot, and nothing a command says that the screen says
//! differently.
//!
//! Split the way the install screen it embeds is: [`state`] is what a key
//! does, [`ui`] is what the screen looks like, and this file is the loop and
//! the work: the only parts that touch a terminal or a disk.
