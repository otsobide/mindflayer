//! Command line interface for Mindweaver, split the way the model is.
//!
//! `mind <cmd>` acts on the mind project you are standing in. `mind weaver
//! <cmd>` acts on the weaver workspace above it, and the `mindweaver` binary is
//! the same tree reached directly, so `mindweaver link x` and `mind weaver link x`
//! are one command with two spellings.
//!
//! The parser, the work and the rendering all live in this library rather
//! than in the binaries so the tests drive the real command surface instead of
//! shelling out, and so both binaries cannot drift apart.
//!
//! Each has a module of its own (`parse`, `commands` with a module per family
//! of commands, and `render`), so that work on one command does not collide
//! with work on another in one long file. What the binaries and the tests use
//! is public: the two screens, and what is re-exported here.
