//!
//! A command as every other is, reached from both binaries through the one
//! parser, with one difference it shares with the TUI: the link is written
//! as it runs rather than built and handed back, since it has to reach the
//! person, and the browser, while the server is up, which is the whole time
//! the command runs. What comes back once it stops is what the TUI hands
//! back when it closes: every line that changed something, with what each
//! said, so the session can be read and done again without the panel.
