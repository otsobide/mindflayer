//! `mindweaver install`: the screen for putting skills and rules into projects.
//!
//! The screen only marks boxes. Everything marked is carried out when you
//! say so, as the `mindweaver install` and `mindweaver uninstall` lines it amounts
//! to ([`Screen::task`]), each parsed and run as typed, the way the TUI runs
//! every line; and what they said is printed afterwards as the TUI's
//! transcript prints it, each line and then what it said. So the report
//! shows exactly what ran, and can be run again without the screen.
