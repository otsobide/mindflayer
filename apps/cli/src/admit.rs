//! A task from outside, held to the path policy before a line of it is
//! built: what the panel's backend runs in place of what the browser sent.
//!
//! Every task the panel sends is untrusted (D-18). The rule that no value is
//! read as an option or a command ([`crate::task`]) keeps a value from
//! changing what a line is; this keeps each value a browser could aim at
//! the disk to what the workspace the panel was launched on allows
//! ([`mindflayer_core::policy`]), and names each project to the command by
//! the path its entry resolves to, never as the browser spelled it:
//!
//! - **A holder** is an entry the registry holds, and becomes the `-C` of
//!   the folder it points at, absolute, in the one `-C` the line has, with
//!   `-W .` in front where `mind` would otherwise consult another workspace
//!   about it, as the TUI decides for its rows.
//! - **Each project an install, an uninstall, an adoption or a migration
//!   names** is an entry too, and becomes the `-p` of the same folder.
//! - **An entry `unlink`, `unload` or `relink` takes** is one the marker
//!   holds, and goes to the command as the marker spells it, which is what
//!   those commands take an entry by.
//! - **A folder `link`, `load`, `init` or the minds screen's marks name**,
//!   the panel's marks among them, is absolute, spelled normalized and
//!   outside every `.mindflayer`, and goes to the command verbatim, so the
//!   preview shows the folder it acts on; one marked to unlink is one an
//!   entry points at.
//!
//! The walk over the variants is here, beside `Task`; what each value may be
//! is core's, so a second front end taking tasks from outside asks the same
//! questions and gets the same answers.
