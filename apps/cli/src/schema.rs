//! What the CLI's backend is sent and answers with, as JSON Schema (#217):
//! the `schema` feature's, as core's types are core's
//! (`mindweaver_core::schema`).
//!
//! Derived, every type serde reads or writes, beside its TypeScript: a
//! query, a task, a switch and the bodies of the reads that take one, which
//! the backend is sent, are described as serde reads them; what a scan, a
//! plan, a preview and a run are answered with, and the envelope a reading
//! command's `--json` prints, as serde writes them. What they name of
//! core's is described as core describes it. Only `Code`, which serde
//! never sees, is written by hand.
//!
//! Beside them, what is part of the API without being the backend's: the
//! token file `ui --token-file` writes, which a script reads before it
//! sends anything, and the server's own answers, a preview, a run, an event
//! and a refusal (`mindweaver_server::schema::roots`), which the server
//! names and the CLI lists, since it is the API the CLI serves.
