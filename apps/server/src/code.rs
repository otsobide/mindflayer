//! A stable code for everything the server answers under `/api` that is no
//! success of its own making: one word a script acts on, beside the words a
//! person reads.
//!
//! The status says which family a refusal is of, and the message what went
//! wrong in detail, the route, the parameter, the header, what was expected
//! and what came. Neither is enough for a program: several conditions share
//! a status (a 403 is a Host, an Origin or a header the panel's page sends),
//! and the message is reworded whenever it is made clearer. So every answer
//! the server gives that is no success carries a code beside its message,
//! as every refusal of a backend's does, and every error core gives.
//!
//! The server's codes are its own, written here once. Core's `codes!`
//! would be the natural tool, but the server depends on no mindweaver crate
//! (`tests/crate_test.rs`), so it mirrors its rules instead:
//!
//! - **One code per condition**, named for it, in snake_case, in as few
//!   words as tell it from every other: `token_required`, `unknown_route`.
//! - **Written as a match with no wildcard**, by `codes!`, which takes one
//!   variant per arm and writes [`Condition::code`], [`Condition::status`],
//!   [`Condition::ALL`] and [`Condition::CODES`] from the same arms: a new
//!   condition does not compile until it has a code and a status, and
//!   cannot have one the list leaves out.
//! - **Unique beside core's and the CLI's.** A code reaches a client
//!   without the crate it came from, so `invalid_body` must mean the same
//!   whoever said it. The server cannot see the other two lists, so the
//!   CLI, which depends on all three crates, holds them apart in a test
//!   (`error_test.rs`).
//! - **A contract once given**, as a serialized name is: a code is never
//!   renamed, nor moved to another condition. Rewording a message changes
//!   none.
//!
//! A backend's refusal carries its own front end's code
//! ([`Refusal`](crate::Refusal)), never one of these: the server gives a
//! code only to a condition it found itself.
