//! What the server answers with of its own, as JSON Schema (#217), and its
//! part of the description of the API as an OpenAPI 3.1 document (#218):
//! what the `schema` feature adds, and nothing else builds.
//!
//! The API is described by JSON Schema written from the Rust types (D-24):
//! a front end's for what its backend is sent and answers, and the
//! server's own for what it answers whatever the backend, a preview, a run,
//! the events and a refusal. Derived beside each type's serde derive, as a
//! front end's are, so what a schema says is what serde writes. What the
//! backend hands over as JSON the server carries unread, so each place for
//! it, an item of a preview's `confirm`, a run's `outcome`, a change's
//! scope, is any JSON here: which of the backend's types fills it is the
//! front end's to say, as a description of its routes names its own types.
//!
//! The front end lists these beside its own roots ([`roots`]), since it is
//! its API they are part of; the server depends on no front end's crate, so
//! it names them through a [`Visitor`] of its own.
//!
//! The document is put together by the front end, which knows every type a
//! route names, and the server writes its part of it ([`paths`]): what is
//! HTTP, and the same whatever the backend. Each route of both tables, the
//! backend's and its own, with its method, its parameters, its body, what
//! it answers and every way it may be refused, the token's two ways in and
//! the events as a stream; each type a route names asked of the front end
//! ([`Describe`]), by the name the table gives it or the word the server's
//! own table has for it ([`Sent`], [`Carried`]). So the server spells no
//! type of the front end's, and the front end no rule of HTTP's.
