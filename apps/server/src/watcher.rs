/// - **Each folder on its own** ([`RecursiveMode::NonRecursive`]), never a
///   tree: a recursive watch costs one of the system's watches for every
///   folder under it, and wakes for every file a build writes.
/// - **A path that is not there yet** is watched from the nearest folder
///   above it that is, for its being made; once it is, the list is asked
///   for again and it is watched itself.
/// - **A folder above a path is a change to it.** Removed or renamed, it
///   takes the path with it, and is all that is told: `rm -rf` of a
///   project, or `mv` of its `.claude`, is told by that one folder alone.
/// - **Asked for again after every change it tells**, since a change can
///   name new paths, and a folder an event named is watched again, with
///   every folder below it: a watch stays with the folder it was set on, so
///   one renamed away, or replaced by a rename over it, as an install puts
///   a copy in place, takes the watch with it.
/// - **What a read does is no change.** A file opened or closed unwritten
///   is passed over, or a snapshot reading a watched file would set off
///   the next snapshot, without end.
/// - **A watch that cannot be set** is said, once, as
///   [`Event::Unwatched`], the rest kept, and tried again with the next
///   change; never a failure of the server. The system's limit on watches
///   is the usual one.
